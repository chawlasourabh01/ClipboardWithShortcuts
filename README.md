# ClipboardWithShortcuts
It is a new way of the clipboard with shortcut commands like C+1 which can be used in any application for copying &amp; pasting simultaneously. We can add up to 9 text boxes with a single button click, which will add textbox &amp; shortcuts to it automatically based on queue. We have to specify the value for each textbox, later we can copy &amp; paste (both the command) those values in any other application with just a press of C+1 simultaneously, for the next text box C+2 &amp; goes on....
